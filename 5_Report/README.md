# Requirements
## Introduction
 * This project is based on simple unit converter which is used to convert one unit of length to another.
 * It has a wide range of usage in the field of carpentary, road constructions,textiles,electricals,educational institutes.
 * It has a wide range of conversions.
 * It promotes the usage of standard SI units.
 * It helps in reducing errors that occur during unit conversions.
 


# Research
 * On looking into some journals and papers it was infered that SI units play a critical role in calculations and modelling.
 * In all mechanical and automated industries, the equipments generally accept only SI units.
 * On a day-to-day basis the products available in the markets are only available in standard measurements,so this unit converter could be used to convert the      measurements we record to the standard measurements available in the market.


# The 4W's and a H 
## WHAT
  * It is a simple unit convertor for converting one unit to another unit .
## WHY
